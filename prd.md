📄 HushHour – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

A Real-Time, Anonymous Q&A System for Events, Sessions & Workshops

1. Product Overview

HushHour is a real-time, anonymous question platform designed for group environments such as hackathons, college events, workshops, panels, and speaker sessions. It allows participants to ask questions freely without social anxiety, and enables organizers/speakers to understand audience sentiment in real time.

The core value:
👉 Removing the psychological barrier to asking questions.
👉 Giving organizers a live pulse of what the audience actually thinks.

2. Problem Statement

In almost every event or session:

90% of participants hesitate to ask questions publicly.

Fear of embarrassment, judgment, or “asking something stupid” silences them.

Organizers often think they engaged the audience, but they never really know.

Audience questions are scattered across WhatsApp, Instagram, or not asked at all.

This leads to:

Unasked doubts

Poor event feedback

Repeated questions

Low engagement

Incomplete communication

HushHour solves this by making audience expression effortless, anonymous, and real-time.
